The Business Source License (this “License”) is not an Open Source license.
However, the Licensed Work will eventually be made available under the Change
License, as stated above.

1. License Grant
   Subject to the conditions of this License, the Licensor grants you a
   non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to
   copy, modify, create derivative works of, redistribute, and make
   non-Production Use of the Licensed Work.

2. Production Use Not Permitted (Except as Allowed by the Additional Use Grant)
   “Production Use” means use of the Licensed Work in any way that is intended
   for or directed toward production, commercial, revenue-generating, or other
   use in or for the benefit of end users (including internal end users).
   Prior to the Change Date, Production Use is prohibited unless expressly
   permitted by the Additional Use Grant above.

3. Change Date and Change License
   On the Change Date, the rights granted under this License automatically and
   irrevocably become subject to the Change License listed above, and you may,
   at your option, continue to use the Licensed Work under this License or
   under the Change License. The Licensor will not revoke or retroactively
   alter the Change License for versions released before the Change Date.

4. No Trademark License
   This License does not grant any right, title, or interest in or to the names,
   logos, or trademarks of the Licensor.

5. Patents
   No patent rights are granted under this License.

   THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES

   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK IS
   WITH YOU.

7. Limitation of Liability

   ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED WORK, EVEN IF
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. Termination
   If you materially breach this License, your rights under this License
   terminate automatically. Upon termination, you must cease all use and
   distribution of the Licensed Work. Sections 4–7 survive termination.

9. Miscellaneous
   This License constitutes the entire agreement concerning its subject matter.
   If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. This
   License is governed by the law applicable where the Licensor is located,
   excluding conflict-of-law rules.
